    biases: [
        { name: "Confirmation Bias", desc: "This is the mind’s tendency to actively seek out, interpret, and recall information that aligns with what you already believe or hypothesize, while conveniently ignoring or downplaying evidence that contradicts it. For instance, if you think labeled diets work, you might focus on success stories and brush off failures, reinforcing your view despite mixed data." },
        { name: "Anchoring Bias", desc: "This occurs when you place too much weight on the first piece of information you encounter—the 'anchor'—when making decisions, even if it’s random or unrelated. Imagine negotiating a car price: if the seller starts at $20,000, your counteroffer might hover around that number, even if the car’s worth far less." },
        { name: "Availability Heuristic", desc: "This mental shortcut leads you to judge the probability of events based on how readily examples spring to mind, often influenced by recent or dramatic incidents. After seeing a plane crash on the news, you might overestimate flying risks, even though driving is statistically more dangerous." },
        { name: "Dunning-Kruger Effect", desc: "A fascinating quirk where those with limited knowledge or skill in a domain overestimate their abilities because they don’t grasp their own shortcomings, while highly skilled people might doubt themselves due to awareness of complexity. Think of a novice cook boasting about their skills versus a chef who’s humbly refining theirs." },
        { name: "Hindsight Bias", desc: "Once an event happens, this bias tricks you into thinking it was predictable all along, making the past seem more obvious than it was. After a team wins a championship, you might say, 'I knew they’d do it,' even if you were unsure during the season." },
        { name: "Sunk Cost Fallacy", desc: "This is the urge to stick with a failing endeavor—be it time, money, or effort—because you’ve already invested so much, even when cutting losses makes more sense. Picture staying in a bad movie just because you paid for the ticket, hoping it gets better." },
        { name: "Framing Effect", desc: "How information is worded or presented can drastically sway your choices, even if the facts don’t change. A surgery with a '90% success rate' sounds more appealing than one with a '10% failure rate,' though they’re identical, influencing your decision based on emotional pull." },
        { name: "Self-Serving Bias", desc: "This is when you credit your successes to your own brilliance or hard work but blame failures on outside forces like luck or others’ mistakes. If you ace a test, it’s your smarts; if you flunk, it’s the teacher’s fault—protecting your ego either way." },
        { name: "Bandwagon Effect", desc: "You’re more likely to adopt a belief or behavior because everyone else is doing it, assuming the crowd’s momentum signals truth. Think of jumping on a viral trend—like buying a gadget—because it’s everywhere, not because you’ve vetted it." },
        { name: "Normalcy Bias", desc: "This is the comforting but risky assumption that life will keep rolling along as it always has, causing you to underestimate the likelihood or severity of disruptions. During a hurricane warning, you might stay home thinking, 'It’s never flooded here before,' ignoring real danger." },
        { name: "Overconfidence Bias", desc: "This happens when you’re overly sure of your own knowledge, skills, or predictions, often glossing over risks or gaps. Picture someone betting big on a stock 'gut feeling' without research, only to be blindsided by a crash." },
        { name: "Negativity Bias", desc: "Your brain gives more attention and emotional weight to negative experiences or information than positive ones, skewing your outlook. A single harsh comment might stick with you longer than a dozen compliments, shaping how you see yourself." },
        { name: "Recency Bias", desc: "This is when the latest events or data overshadow older ones in your mind, tilting your decisions. If a friend’s been nice lately, you might forgive years of flakiness, focusing only on the fresh good vibes." },
        { name: "Attribution Bias", desc: "You tend to chalk up others’ actions to their personality ('They’re just lazy') while excusing your own as situational ('I was tired'). If someone cuts you off in traffic, they’re a jerk; if you do it, it’s because you’re late." },
        { name: "Loss Aversion", desc: "The fear of losing something outweighs the joy of gaining something equal, driving you to avoid risks. You might cling to a sinking stock rather than sell, dreading the loss more than you’d celebrate a similar gain." },
        { name: "Status Quo Bias", desc: "You favor keeping things as they are over changing them, even if change could improve your life, due to comfort or fear of the unknown. Sticking with a clunky old phone plan because switching feels like a hassle is a classic case." },
        { name: "Optimism Bias", desc: "This is the rosy belief that you’re less likely to face misfortune and more likely to hit the jackpot compared to others. You might skip insurance thinking, 'I won’t get sick,' while assuming promotions come easy." },
        { name: "Pessimism Bias", desc: "The flip side, where you overestimate the chances of things going wrong, expecting gloom more than reality justifies. Planning a picnic? You’re sure it’ll rain, even if the forecast says otherwise." },
        { name: "Halo Effect", desc: "One glowing trait—like charm or looks—colors your whole view of someone or something, blinding you to flaws. A charismatic speaker might seem brilliant, even if their ideas are shaky." },
        { name: "Illusion of Control", desc: "You overestimate your influence over outcomes, especially random ones, feeding a false sense of power. Blowing on dice or picking 'lucky' numbers in a lottery feels like it boosts your odds, though it doesn’t." },
        { name: "Choice-Supportive Bias", desc: "After picking an option, you defend it by hyping its perks and downplaying its downsides, rewriting history to feel good. Bought a mediocre car? You’ll rave about its mileage and ignore the rattles." },
        { name: "Survivorship Bias", desc: "You focus on what made it through—like successful companies—while ignoring what flopped, skewing your take. Studying only thriving startups might convince you success is common, missing the graveyard of failures." },
        { name: "Gambler’s Fallacy", desc: "This is the flawed idea that past random events sway future ones, like expecting heads after five tails. At a roulette table, you might bet big on black after a red streak, thinking it’s 'due,' despite even odds." },
        { name: "Stereotyping", desc: "You slap broad traits on people based on their group, oversimplifying reality. Assuming all programmers are antisocial geeks ignores the diversity, leaning on lazy mental shortcuts instead." },
        { name: "Blind Spot Bias", desc: "You’re quick to spot biases in others but miss them in yourself, assuming you’re more objective than you are. You might call out a friend’s stubbornness while denying your own dug-in opinions." },
        { name: "Curse of Knowledge", desc: "Once you know something, it’s hard to imagine not knowing it, leading you to overestimate others’ understanding. A teacher might breeze through a concept, forgetting how tricky it was to learn initially." },
        { name: "Outcome Bias", desc: "You judge a decision’s quality by how it turns out, not how sound it was at the time. A risky bet that pays off seems genius in hindsight, even if it was reckless given the odds then." },
        { name: "Mere Exposure Effect", desc: "Familiarity breeds fondness, even without reason—you start liking something just because you’ve seen it a lot. A jingle you hated might grow on you after hearing it on repeat." },
        { name: "Primacy Effect", desc: "The first things you encounter stick harder in your memory and sway your views more than what comes later. Meeting someone charming upfront might overshadow their later rudeness." },
        { name: "Regression to the Mean", desc: "You misread natural ups and downs as meaningful shifts, expecting extremes to last. A student’s fluke high score might seem like a breakthrough, but they’ll likely drift back to average next time." },
        { name: "False Consensus Effect", desc: "You overestimate how many people share your views or habits, projecting your norms onto the world. Loving pineapple on pizza? You might assume most do, despite the heated debates." },
        { name: "Contrast Effect", desc: "Your judgment of something shifts based on what it’s next to, not its own merits. A $50 shirt looks cheap after seeing a $500 one, but pricey next to a $10 tee." },
        { name: "Authority Bias", desc: "You give extra credence to authority figures’ words or actions, even when evidence disagrees. A doctor’s offhand remark might outweigh data in your mind, just because of their title." },
        { name: "Projection Bias", desc: "You assume others think or feel like you do, because it’s your default lens. If you’re mad about a delay, you might figure everyone else is too, missing their indifference." },
        { name: "Clustering Illusion", desc: "Your brain spots patterns in random chaos, tricking you into seeing order where there’s none. Seeing three red cars in a row might feel like a trend, not just chance." },
        { name: "Endowment Effect", desc: "You overvalue what you own simply because it’s yours, making it tough to let go. A beat-up old mug might seem priceless to you, though you’d never buy it off a shelf." },
        { name: "Hyperbolic Discounting", desc: "You crave instant rewards over bigger future ones, irrationally slashing long-term value. Taking $50 now instead of $100 in a year feels better, even if waiting pays off more." },
        { name: "Zero-Risk Bias", desc: "You’d rather erase all risk, even if it’s tiny, than accept a practical trade-off. Paying extra for '100% safe' gear might feel worth it, despite negligible danger otherwise." },
        { name: "Affect Heuristic", desc: "Your emotions steer your decisions, coloring risks and rewards. A sunny mood might make a shaky investment seem golden, while fear could nix a solid opportunity." },
        { name: "Base Rate Neglect", desc: "You overlook broad stats for vivid specifics, skewing your judgment. Hearing a rare disease story might scare you more than its 1% prevalence should warrant." },
        { name: "Omission Bias", desc: "You see doing nothing as less harmful than acting, even if inaction’s worse. Skipping a vaccine might feel safer than risking side effects, despite higher disease odds." },
        { name: "Escalation of Commitment", desc: "You pour more into a failing venture because you’re already invested, refusing to quit. Throwing cash at a dying project 'to make it work' can dig a deeper hole." },
        { name: "Barnum Effect", desc: "You buy into vague, broad statements as personal truths, like in horoscopes. 'You’re insightful yet cautious' feels spot-on, though it fits almost anyone." },
        { name: "Ingroup Bias", desc: "You favor your own crew—family, team, or culture—over outsiders, often unfairly. Cheering your school’s mediocre team while bashing a rival’s stars is a prime example." },
        { name: "Peak-End Rule", desc: "You rate experiences by their high point and finish, not the whole journey. A vacation with a great finale might feel amazing, even if most days were meh." },
        { name: "Law of Small Numbers", desc: "You leap to big conclusions from tiny samples, trusting flimsy data. Three good reviews might convince you a product’s flawless, ignoring broader trends." },
        { name: "Hot-Hand Fallacy", desc: "You see a streak—like a basketball run—as skill, not luck, expecting it to continue. A player’s three baskets in a row might make you bet on a fourth, defying chance." },
        { name: "Information Bias", desc: "You hoard data, even useless bits, thinking more info equals better choices. Researching a simple decision to death might delay action without adding clarity." },
        { name: "Ambiguity Effect", desc: "You dodge options with unclear outcomes, even if they could beat known ones, due to unease. Picking a safe job over a vague startup gig might cost you big potential." },
        { name: "Backfire Effect", desc: "When faced with evidence against your beliefs, you dig in harder, rejecting it outright. A climate skeptic might cling tighter to denial after seeing solid data, doubling down." }
